# C-Scribe for Obsidian 🎙️

> A fork of [Scribe](https://github.com/Mikodin/obsidian-scribe) that uses Claude (Anthropic) for summarization instead of OpenAI.

Transform your voice into insights with C-Scribe, an Obsidian plugin that not only records your voice and transcribes it, but summarizes, and enriches the note with the power of Claude AI.

Dive into a seamless experience where your spoken words are effortlessly converted into a structured, easy-to-navigate knowledge base.

Forgot a phrase or concept while recording? Ask "Hey Scribe" followed by a question in the middle of recording and it will fill in the blanks for you.

## 🔄 Changes from Original Scribe

This fork replaces OpenAI with:
- **AssemblyAI** for audio transcription (required)
- **Claude (Anthropic)** for intelligent summarization

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Voice-to-Text Magic:** Begin recording and watch as your voice notes are transcribed, summarized, and turned into actionable insights.
- **Robust on Failure:** Designed with mobile users in mind, C-Scribe ensures that no step in the process is a single point of failure. Record, transcribe, and summarize on the go, with each step saved progressively.
- **Seamless Integration:** Utilizes AssemblyAI for transcription and Claude for cutting-edge summarization
- **Create your custom templates:** Harness the language models and insert your own custom prompts as template!
- **Multi Language Support:** Select your language and go wild!
- **Interactive Queries:** Ask questions mid-recording, and Scribe fetches the answers, integrating them directly into your notes.
- **Mermaid Chart Creation:** Visualize your thoughts and summaries with automatically generated Mermaid charts, providing a unique perspective on your notes.

## 🕹️ Commands
### From the Ribbon button
- Either Click Start Recording or Open the Controls Modal
### From the Command Pallette type "Scribe"
- **Begin Recording with Scribe:** - Opens the controls modal for you to begin recording
- **Transcribe & Summarize Current File:** - Run this on an open audio file - it will Scribe this file. Very useful for recording offline and later Scribing it
- **Fix Mermaid Chart:** - Sometimes the generated Mermaid Chart is invalid, this will attempt to fix it.

## ⚙️ Settings / Config

- **Anthropic API Key (Required):** Essential for Claude summarization. Set your key in the `Settings`.

Get your key here - [Anthropic Console - https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)

- **AssemblyAI Key (Required):** For audio transcription. Enjoy a $50 credit from AssemblyAI to get started.

Get your key in the [AssemblyAI Dev Console https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account](https://www.assemblyai.com/app/account)

- **Audio Input Device:** Select which microphone to use for recording. By default, the system's default audio input device will be used.

- **Audio File Format:** We only support `.webm` as browsers across all devices either support webm or wav. Because of the size, `.wav` is not considered

- **Disable LLM Summarization:** If enabled, audio will only be transcribed without sending to Claude for summarization.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation (Manual)

1. Download the latest release from the Releases page
2. Extract to your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/c-scribe/` folder
3. In Obsidian, navigate to `Settings` > `Community Plugins`
4. Enable `C-Scribe`
5. Configure your API keys in the plugin settings
6. Obsidian may need explicit permission to access to your microphone; depending on where you're running it, you may be prompted or need to enable this manually (e.g. in System Settings → Security & Privacy → Microphone).

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Start Recording:** Trigger the Scribe action or select it from the ribbon and begin recording
2. **Interactive Queries:** Pose questions during recording to have them answered and integrated into your notes just say "Hey Scribe" followed by the question.
3. **Review and Explore:** Access the transcribed text, summary, insights, and Mermaid charts directly in your note.

## 📱 Mobile

C-Scribe shines in mobile scenarios, gracefully handling interruptions or connectivity issues. If any step fails, simply resume without losing any progress.

### Known Issues
1. On iOS, the screen must be **ON** while recording otherwise it won't capture your voice. This is a limitation of Obsidian.
